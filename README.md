### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a highly motivated developer and EdTech Professional. After spending 15 years in the classroom, I am transitioning into a more technical role. I learned the basics of 6 coding languages in a year and built my first from-scratch website (here on github) in 3 months using HTML/Css/JavaScript. My favorite language is Java, but I can also work with PHP, SQL, and Python. I can do everything from Drupal mantainance to O365 SharePoint builds, LMS administration to content design for ages 10 through adult. I am also an AWS certified Cloud Practitioner and trained as an admin for Red Hat Enterpirise Linux.
