### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a highly motivated developer and EdTech Professional. After spending 15 years in the classroom, I am transitioning into a more technical role. I learned the basics of 6 coding languages in a year and built my first from-scratch website (here on github) in 3 months. I can do everything from Drupal mantainance to O365 SharePoint builds, LMS administration to content design for ages 10 through adult. I am also an AWS certified Cloud Practitioner.
